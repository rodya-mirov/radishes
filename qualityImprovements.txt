- Keyboard focus shouldn't matter; top-level key interceptor for shortcuts
- Keydown/keyup navigation would be a lot nicer

- Drag'n'drop interaction with the map would be nice

- Monsters using images instead of circles would be nice
- Tiles using images instead of boxes would be nice

- Some kind of particle effect when a monster dies

- Somehow preventing monsters from completely coinciding would be nice
    Not sure what's to be done about this
