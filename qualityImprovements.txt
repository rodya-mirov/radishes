- Keyboard focus shouldn't matter; top-level key interceptor for shortcuts
- Make tile mod div collapsible
- Make trap builder div collapsible

- Dragon drop interaction with the map would be nice
- Mouse wheel zoom for the map would be nice
- Re-rendering everything every frame is janky

- Monsters using images instead of circles would be nice

- Tiles using images instead of boxes would be nice

- Some kind of particle effect when a monster dies
- Some kind of particle effect when a monster takes damage

- Gas as a counter on a map is cool, but it means we can't naturally affect it
    with other systems (e.g. wind) which is lame. Maybe refactor it to be an
    entity (this does make some things more complicated)

- Somehow preventing monsters from completely coinciding would be nice
    Not sure what's to be done about this
