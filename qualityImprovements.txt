- Keyboard focus shouldn't matter; top-level key interceptor for shortcuts

- Dragon drop interaction with the map would be nice
- Mouse wheel zoom for the map would be nice
- Re-rendering everything every frame is janky

- Monsters using images instead of circles would be nice

- Tiles using images instead of boxes would be nice

- Core and Spawn should be structures; this would induce a significant refactor of how map works but it's fine

- Selling traps should only give you back a fraction of what you spent, so that you can't spam
- selling traps should have a cost set in a non-fixed / non-janky way (probably a multiple of the buy price)
- Building / selling traps and modifying tiles should take time (???)
- Shouldn't be able to build multiple traps on one space (???)
- UI for buy/sell needs work, the information is there but it looks like hot garbage

- Refactor: consider not doing any tile mods at all; everything is "open", some things are "permanent blockers"
    and we don't have an infinite map. A system between modifications and monster actions can build the map
    cache from entities.

    Then we can have things like destructible tiles and so on, more nicely

- Some kind of particle effect when a monster dies
- Some kind of particle effect when a monster takes damage

- Gas as a counter on a map is cool, but it means we can't naturally affect it
    with other systems (e.g. wind) which is lame. Maybe refactor it to be an
    entity (this does make some things more complicated)

- Somehow preventing monsters from completely coinciding would be nice
    Not sure what's to be done about this
