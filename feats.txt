Next feature set:
	basic TD
		should have a map with consistent tiles
		should have monsters that proceed from the beginning to the end
		should be able to build traps (guns?)
			traps cost resources
			once built, traps damage and perhaps kill monsters
		wave system (after x ticks, next wave spawns)
		some kind of death condition (if a mob hits your core, you lose one health; if you lose all health, you "die")

	set 1a:
		a tilemap exists in the ECS and can be rendered
		tiles are just "open" and "wall"
		prepopulated in init, static
		use solid colors with borders for now (rendered in code with fillRect)

	set 1b:
		can click on tiles and some kind of "useful information" appears in an infopane

	set 1c:
		add tiles "spawn" and "goal"
		prepopulated in init, static

    set 1d:
        keyboard scrolling around the td (arrows to move)
        probably a camera in ECS resources
