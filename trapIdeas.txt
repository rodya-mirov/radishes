Spike trap / caltrops:
    Sits on the ground
    Enemies take damage every unit of distance they pass through it
    Flying enemies are immune

    Tile availability:
        x   Open
        -   Wall, Spawn, Core

Gas trap:
    Hovers ambiently in the air (possibly in a pathing radius from an emanation)
    Enemies take damage every tick they're in the gas

    Tile availability (source):
        x   Open
        -   Wall, Spawn, Core

    Spreads to Spawn and Core as well

    --- Strategy note; caltrop total damage is unaffected by speed
        but gas does less to fast mobs, and more to slow mobs. Also
        the flying difference

Pits:
    New tile type, not passable
    If a walking enemy is somehow on the pit, they fall in and die

Fans:
    Trap type, has a direction and a range
    Each tick, applies a movement, inverse proportional to the mob's inertia (note flyers have low inertia)
    Also blows gas around (???)
    can be used to slow down enemies or, if they're light enough, push them into a pit

Guns:
    Stick it on a wall, it shoots enemies
    Damage / shot and recharge time are the fiddly bits
    One enemy per bullet

    Note: aiming is a concern; does it fire randomly, does it shoot straight, does it lead, etc.

Grenade launchers:
    Like guns, but do AOE damage when the pellet hits

Slow goop:
    Trap type, on the ground
    Enemies move more slowly across it

Push traps:
    trap type, has a direction
    When it triggers, applies a movement, inverse proportional to the mob's inertia (note flyers have low inertia)

    Higher movement delta than fans, but triggers only when an enemy is in range, and has a cooldown

Harpoon traps:
    Analogous to push traps, but pull toward the trap
