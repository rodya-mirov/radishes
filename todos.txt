Next feature set:
	basic TD
		should have a map with consistent tiles
		should have monsters that proceed from the beginning to the end
		should be able to build traps (guns?)
			traps cost resources
			once built, traps damage and perhaps kill monsters
		wave system (after x ticks, next wave spawns)
		some kind of death condition (if a mob hits your core, you lose one health; if you lose all health, you "die")

	set 3a:
		monsters exist (prepopulated in init, static) and are rendered
		just simple circles for now

	set 3b:
		exactly one spawn + core tile
		monsters spawn at spawn point
		monsters proceed to core

	set 3c:
		health loss can occur

    set 3d:
		if health <= 0, some kind of death condition (design TBA; better than "crash the game")

	set 4a:
		spike traps can be built in exchange for resources
		traps exist in space; appear in infopane

	set 4b:
		every tick that monsters are on a spike trap, they take damage
		if a monster's health goes to zero, they die
		if a monster dies, player gets some kind of resource
